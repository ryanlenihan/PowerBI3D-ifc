This is a fork of the [PowerBI3D repository](https://github.com/diego-apellaniz/PowerBI3D) that uses the threejs ifcloader to visualize *.ifc models in Power BI.
This version only supports IFC files.

‚úÖ there seems to be an issue with fetching web-ifc.wasm  
    -> turned out to be an issue with IFCLoader.js  
    -> i botched by changing line 3345 in web-ifc-three@0.0.122/IFCLoader.js  
    -> from  this.state.api.SetWasmPath(path);  
    -> to    this.state.api.SetWasmPath(path, true);  
    -> this should also solve the issue described here
